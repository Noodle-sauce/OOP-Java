//The template you get from the test automaton has a start for an implementation of binary search. 
//The class BinarySearch holds a method public static boolean search(int[] array, int searchedValue), 
//the job of which is to figure out, by using binary search, 
//if the value given as a parameter is in the sorted array that is also given as parameter. 
//The method search does not work yet, however. Finish the method's implementation into a real binary search.
