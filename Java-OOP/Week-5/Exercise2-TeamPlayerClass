//Create a class Player with the instance variables for the player name and the number of goals. A player should have two constructors: one that initializes the name and another that initializes the name and the number of goals. Implement also the following methods:
//getName, returns the player's name
//getGoals, returns the number of goals
//toString, returns a string representation that is formed as in the example below
